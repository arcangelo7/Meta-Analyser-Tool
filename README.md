# Computational Thinking Project
This is the [Computational Thinking](https://comp-think.github.io/) final project.

Python software that accepts in input a file in CSV format, containing metadata on existing academic articles. The goal is to perform analysis on such data, such as: 
- returning the id of articles from a string or other metadata from an id;
- allowing to filter by field and value;
- obtaining a graph of the co-authors of a specific author;
- getting a graph of all the authors included in the file, concerning their co-authors.
